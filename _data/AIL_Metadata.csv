ail_001,On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? ðŸ¦œ,"Bender, M. Emily; Gebru, Timnit; McMillian-Major; Shmitchell, Shmargaret",2021-03-01,"The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.",Generative AI;,"RIbaric, Tim",image/jpeg,eng,ail_001.png,screen capture of first page of paper

How is AI shaping our understanding of ourselves and our societies? Drawing on more than a decade of research, awardâ€‘winning scholar Kate Crawford reveals how AI is a technology of extraction: from the minerals drawn from the earth to the labor pulled from low-wage information workers to the data taken from every action and expression.",Conflict Minerals,"RIbaric, Tim",image/jpeg,eng,ail_002.png,screen capture of title page
